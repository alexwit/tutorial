What gap in the user experience can you infer from the app’s functionality? Define this gap or problem very precisely. Is this problem uniquely solved by a mobile app? Or are there websites that provide a solution to the same problem? In other words, what is the added value of providing it as an app?

Back in the day before the use of gps and smartphones/ watches you needed to calculate your running speed by running  a pre-scheduled route and keep track of the time. Then you would divide time by distance to calculate an average time per kilometer. This would not give good data to keep track of your progress or where it went wrong because of a wrong pase.  With the use of GPS tracking and the runkeeper - app  it’s possible to give on the spot feedback on running performance and keeps track on which route and distance you have run. 
It is possible to plan your route upfront and let a website calculate and average overall time of the route you have run. But this will not be able to show data of each individual kilometer.   By creating an app which can use the data of GPS the runner can keep track of his locatian, hight variety and time runned per second. 

Do you think the designer really understands the problem? What are clues in the app’s functionality to evidence presence or absence of understanding?

The way the data is stored and showed in graphs and tables is a clear way the builder of the app wanted to create an application that was easy to use and where it would be easy to compare run statistics. Because the data can be shown per minute you get a good overview and you can even compare with others. Because of the extra features that motivates you to run and is able to give training schedules for certain goals you see that the builder of the app knows which problem runners run in to and is able to help. 

What market segments can you define for this app? In other words, does it serve different kindsof people? Which are these?

The Runkeeper app is in first instance for long distance runners. But it also has features for bikers and for example snowboarding, actually every physical activity where you get from point A to point B. This means that every sporter that crosses a certain distance over a terrain where it is able to track a GPS there is a possibility to use the app. It also gives training advice and motivational support for people who want to lose weight. This can be from every age-group and people with different fitness levels. 

List examples of needs that could be fulfilled for different market segments served by this app. Have a look at competing apps to come up with needs that may not be fulfilled by the app you chose.

It could use the data it stores about sporters and use it for medicinal research. It could also be used for insurance company’s to use as big Data for health studies where there is checked if people who run more often live healthier lives and are therefor cheaper clients. Other apps give also other fitness exercises examples. This app is best for people who are interested in the data but for the rest it’s quite sober.  

Prepare and submit one discussion question about the chapters above. We will discuss some of these in class.

Ulrich or rather Theodore Levit states that people sometimes ask for a solution for a problem because that is the standard way to overcome the problem. He gives an example where people want to put up a bookshelf. They are look ing for an ¼ inch drill bit to drive a  ¼ inch hole. Because that is the standard way to put up a bookshelf. But it doesn’t mean it is the only way  to put up  bookshelf. The question at hand is how do you come up with an solution for a problemn which will become the standard solution. Or at least how do you know that people will use your solution for the problem and see it as the best one.
